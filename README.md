Project Overview:

Our project focuses on studying long COVID patients worldwide in order
to gain a better understanding of this illness. To accomplish this, we
have diligently searched for available datasets on the internet and
analyzed them to identify valuable patterns. Although our research is
still ongoing, we are pleased to offer the curated dataset we have
compiled to other researchers and professionals who share an interest in
this field. This dataset can be utilized for in-depth analysis and
further exploration of long COVID.

Installation Instructions:

1.) Download the Curated Dataset: Download the Curated_Long_CV.rds file, which
contains the curated dataset in the R platform.

2.) Load the Dataset in R: To use the shared dataframe, follow these
steps to load it into your R environment:

myDataframe \<- readRDS("path/to/Curated_Long_CV.rds")

Make sure to replace "path/to/Curated_Long_CV.rds" with the actual file path
and name of the Curated_Long_CV.rds file.

3.) Start Working with the Dataset: Once the dataframe is loaded, you
can work with it in your R sessions just like any other dataframe.
Perform data analysis, visualization, or any other operations you
require using the myDataframe variable.
